# Blog_Generation
A serverless blog generation system using AWS Lambda, Amazon Bedrock (Meta LLaMA 3), and S3. It receives prompts via API Gateway, generates content using Bedrock, stores the output as text files in S3, and logs activity with CloudWatch. Postman is used for API testing. Lightweight, scalable, and fully cloud-native.
